 **i was created this project to asking that user some questions and the answer must be "yes or y or n or no ".**
### Reflections and Comments :
+ **How did this go, overall?** 
*actually, I face some problems like I forgot semicolon or parentheses but it's good*
+ **What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?** 
*i learn a new something how to Trace the lines to discover the problem.*
+ **How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**
*it takes about three hours and expected that*

**today i write a nice code that I used for the loop to give user four attempts to guess the number and I use an array to another game and use a nested loop for this array one of them to count the attempts and another to access to array and search inside it, and I used the variable to count the number of correct answers.**
